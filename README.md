# Obnam Spec Files

These spec files are adopted from the ones included in the srpm's found in the EPEL 6 repo. They've been modified as little as possible to get them using the newer package versions, and building cleanly under EL 7.

I have these packages built via COPR, which can be found [here](https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/sedunne/obnam/).
